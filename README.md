This project is an example to showcase my knowledge in shell scripting and demonstrating the step by step process of data cleaning, data manipulation, analysis and deriving insights from data through visualization in an html format.

To view the shell scripts:

1. Click the "plothistogram.sh" and "ploturltrend.sh" files.
2. To view the output of the program, check the html files (or jpeg files)
