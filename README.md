This project is an example to showcase my knowledge in shell scripting and demonstrating the step by step process of data cleaning, data manipulation, analysis and deriving insights from a data large dataset (logfile from a web-server). Visualizations are generated in html formats.

To view the shell scripts:

1. Click the "plothistogram.sh" and "ploturltrend.sh" files.
2. To view the output of the program, check the html files (or jpeg files)
