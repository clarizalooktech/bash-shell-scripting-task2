This project is an example to showcase my knowledge in shell scripting and demonstrating the step by step process of data cleaning, data manipulation, analysis and deriving insights from data through visualization in an html format.

To view the shell scripts:

1. Click the "plothistogram.sh" file.
2. Download the "html-file.zip" file on your desktop and upzip to see html file.
